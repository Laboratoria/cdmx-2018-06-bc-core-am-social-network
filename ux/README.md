# SOCIAL NETWORK FOR FEMINIST WOMANS

The **feminist movement** has become one of the main issues in today's society. Globally it is an important movement that is generating ideas, feelings, policies and important changes in daily life.

> *Feminism is a diverse collection of social theories, political movements, and moral philosophies. Some versions are critical of past and present social relations. Many focus on analyzing what they believe to be social constructions of gender and sexuality. Many focus on studying gender inequality and promoting women's rights, interests, and issues.*  -What is Feminism?; Women & Gender Studies, Eastern Kentucky University

Millions of women have joined feminism in recent years, but there is no social network for them. Using social networks like facebook, twitter, instagram, etc. **they do not have an exclusive social network for them.**

# Research and investigation

The feminist movement in Mexico has high activity in social networks. Social networks such as facebook or twitter are one of their main tools and bastions. Although Facebook groups are used by feminists as spaces to share and create support networks, they are constantly harassed  by their ideology.
Having no alternatives they choose to continue in these groups but they have to take care of themselves all the time. Her groups are private and other women can not join unless another woman in the group invites her.

The information they share is massive, so much of it passes out.

An investigation was carried out in the main social networks, and Google, searched for alternatives for feminist women.

In the facebook groups a group with more than 8 thousand Mexican users was located, "Mercadita Feminista" is a group for sales but there is a great activity on the part of the users who exchange information such as:
 - Support Network   
 - Consultation    
 - Sales / Purchases / Barters /
 - Services
 - Events    
 - Relief

It remains a secret group due to the cyber bullying they receive, filtering of personal data has also been reported.

The information obtained was analyzed and concentrated on [Business Model Canvas](https://realtimeboard.com/app/board/o9J_kzKLMY8=/)
